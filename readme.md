A Google Chrome extension that allows you to:
- Enlarge the images in a Metabase Question by clicking them
- Click an image again to toggle it's size back to default (30px tall)
- Customize the size that images enlarge to by adjusting the multiplier in our plugin GUI

This is helpful when users/customers submit photo data that you want to analyze directly in Metabase, rather than having to create a third-party app for this.

### Some examples
- On a "User signups" question for a SaaS app, using this plugin to enlarge and view user avatars, and moderate against AI/fake avatars
- On a "Latest meals added" question for a calorie counter app, using this plugin to enlarge and view the latest photos submitted by users
- On a "Latest deliveries" question for a logistics app, using this plugin to view Proof of delivery photos provided by couriers
